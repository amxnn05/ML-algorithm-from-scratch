## 📌 Overview
This repository contains implementations of popular **Machine Learning algorithms from scratch**. The goal is to deeply understand how these algorithms work under the hood by coding them without using ML libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

> **Note:** The libraries like Scikit-learn and more are only used for comparision purposes.

## 📂 Algorithms Implemented
- [ ] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [x] Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- [x] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- [ ] Decision Tree
- [ ] Random Forest *(coming soon)*
- [ ] Naive Bayes *(coming soon)*
- [ ] Neural Networks *(coming soon)*
